## Core project statement
For my personal passion project, I want to explore the world of 3d fractals because Iâ€™m fascinated by these endlessly repeating patterns. As humans, we are naturally drawn to these patterns without being aware of them. In addition, several studies show that there is a link between fractals & human well-being. Spending time in nature, where there are many fractals, has a positive effect on our mental health, a topic that has become increasingly important in recent years. Being in nature engages all our senses, creating a rich, immersive experience.  By integrating this multi-sensory approach, we can evoke the positive effects of being in nature and foster deeper, more meaningful responses in a digital installation.
### My research question
How can a multi-sensory 3d fractal experience in a digital installation for STEAM enthusiasts highlight the stress-relieving potential of fractals?
## Customer - target audience
My final customers will be STEAM enthusiasts (= Science Technology Engineering Art Mathematics), as they are the best suit the topic.
## Deliverables
- digital installation
### Multi-sensory experience
- interactive fractal(s) that respond to visitor interaction
- 3D printed fractals (touch)
### Exhibition
- a brief text explaining how fractals contribute to mental health and how this is reflected in the installation.
### Collection
- multiple 3d fractals to interact with, each with different interactivity
### Pictures
- process pictures
- end result pictures
