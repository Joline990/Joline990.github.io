## Research question & planning
Today, I wrote down the last things of what I did yesterday in a blog post and selected four research questions. Then I started setting up my schedule in Github projects. I listed the tasks by item, for example all tasks related to the final presentation are named under final presentation to then assign different tasks to a period of days, keeping in mind that there is a daily blog post and work on the final result, in addition to the focus of the day. I also tried to provide some buffers and milestones.

## History
In the evening, I looked up some history on fractals since I had not yet mentioned it.
\
\
There are several mathematicians including Georg Cantor & Gaston Julia who already knew that there was something else not yet discovered in mathematics, however, it is **Benoît Mandelbrot** who introduced the name ‘fractal’ and used a IBM supercomputer in 1980 to visualise this. Between 1980 and 1990, fractals were very popular among mathematicians & scientists, and the term wasn’t always used correctly. In 1982 the first fractal landscape was generated (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal). From then on, fractals have several applications (see previous blog post). To this day, there are still fractal artists working (not necessarily coded, but made with generators) who have 10 years of experience, although they are not many anymore. 

## Small note
I started a bit with exploring different existing fractals (who is the inventor, in what year, formula, peculiarities to the fractal). I will continue this tomorrow.
