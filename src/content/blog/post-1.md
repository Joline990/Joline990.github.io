## Core project statement
For my personal passion project, I want to explore the world of 3d fractals because I’m fascinated by these endlessly repeating patterns. As humans, we are naturally drawn to these patterns without being aware of them. In addition, several studies show that there is a link between fractals & human well-being. Spending time in nature, where there are many fractals, has a positive effect on our mental health, a topic that has become increasingly important in recent years. Being in nature engages all our senses, creating a rich, immersive experience.  By integrating this multi-sensory approach, we can evoke the positive effects of being in nature and foster deeper, more meaningful responses in a digital installation.
### My research question
How can a multi-sensory 3d fractal experience in a digital installation for STEAM enthusiasts highlight the stress-relieving potential of fractals?
## Customer - target audience
My final customers will be STEAM enthusiasts (= Science Technology Engineering Art Mathematics), as they are the best suit the topic.
## Deliverables
- digital installation
### Multi-sensory experience
- interactive fractal(s) that respond to visitor interaction
- 3D printed fractals (touch)
### Exhibition
- a brief text explaining how fractals contribute to mental health and how this is reflected in the installation.
### Collection
- multiple 3d fractals to interact with, each with different interactivity
### Pictures
- process pictures
- end result pictures
