## Code optimization
### Some observations
#### Max_level & rendering
**From level 3 onwards, rendering takes a long time**. By adding interactions, level 3 is not fast enough, because if you set the max_level to 3, for example, and then change other properties, it blocks (blender keeps rendering). You have to be patient for that before it fully loads.

#### MIDI pads 
I could easily link my midi device's control sliders to my custom properties using the MidiController add-on, but the **pads don't work**. I did research on this. I have come to the conclusion that working with pads doesn't work. These work slightly different from sliders. **Pads do not give a value 0 or 1 like a button**, but give a value based on the speed they are pressed (**velocity**). 
\
\
When I reached back to the **documentation of the add-on**, more specifically the videos, I saw in the comments that the **person who created** the add-on was **not yet able to integrate pads**. Looking at the long code files, this seems like a very hard job to do, since 
- I didn't write the code myself, it's harder to understand what someone else did
- I have very little knowledge how to read messages from a midi device...
<br>

It's a shame I hadn't read this before, otherwise I wouldn't have gone for this and might have been able to work somewhere, but in the meantime I have written the code. We are also in the last week, but I need to have a working result at the end of the run.
\
\
Okay just to recap. What do I have and what not?
\
‚úÖ a rhombohedron fractal script in Blender's Python API where I use custom panels to change values and the code also works by adding midi sliders through the add-on.
\
‚ùå midi pads can't work in Blender's Python API using the add-on
\
‚ùå audio ‚Üí but I was already going to leave that out.
\
\
I'd like a **stable end result** at the end. So I'm now going to first write the code I have neatly (remove other comments, make sure I don't have any more errors in my terminal, make sure everything works properly...).
\
\
Best-case scenario that I could still achieve at this point, would be to get both the pads and sliders working, with visible changes in real-time within a standalone Python project. The fractal script is already written, but the interactions still need to be implemented. However, I will focus on making a working end result with no bugs and issues, as was also said at the coach moment.
\
\
I could simply **ensure that the end result is good** and put together further the final presentation and a summary of my project. That's a safe option, I can also **try to get the most out of the project** by doing some more research. That way I can still try to correct my mistake of going in the wrong direction (namely interaction in Blender's Python API). I could document these findings then, maybe in a separate blog post.

### Solve errors
The basic code works. but there are some errors in my terminal that I need to fix first (even with errors, the code works, but we prefer not to see errors üôÇ).
\
Errors:
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...", line 224, in draw
TypeError: UILayout.prop(): error with argument 1, "data" -  Function.data does not support a 'None' assignment AnyType type
```
When & why does this error occur?
\
‚Üí The error happens when no object is drawn. The error means that the first element inside our layout.prop() is None. For the rotations we added `object` as our first element inside layout.prop() and this gives the problem, because there is no object yet.
\
\
Solution
\
‚Üí We could draw something immediately or place an **if-else loop** where if nothing has been drawn on the canvas yet, this custom property is not visible.
```python
class OBJECT_PT_fractal_panel(bpy.types.Panel):
    # ...
    def draw(self, context):
        object = context.object

        if object:
            split = box.split()
                    
            col = split.column()
            col.label(text = "X")
            col.prop(object, "rotation_euler", index = 0)
                    
            col = split.column()
            col.label(text = "Y")
            col.prop(object, "rotation_euler", index = 1)
                
            col = split.column()
            col.label(text = "Z")
            col.prop(object, "rotation_euler", index = 2)
        else:
            box.alert = True
            box.label(text = "Add rhombohedron first!")
```
To make the label text (Add rhombohedron first! stand out), I want to change the color. For that we can use `alert method`, found on https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/8851/in-python-is-it-possible-to-change-the-background-color-of-a-property-ui

```python
Warning: no mesh data to join
```
When & why does this error occur?
\
‚Üí We see the error when max_level = 0, so if only one object is created. This is also normal because you can only create a joined object if there are 2 objects. 
\
\
Solution
‚Üí With `len()` we can ask the length of the array in Python.
```python
# inside update_fractal() function
if len(bpy.data.objects) > 1 :
    bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')
    bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = bpy.data.objects['rhombohedron_object']
    bpy.ops.object.join()
```
Ai, we have another issue, my fractal is not selected if max_level = 0. Looking at the code above, this is also normal because we only select all our objects if the length of all objects is greater than 1. With a small change in our code, everything is fine!
```python
    bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')
    bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = bpy.data.objects['rhombohedron_object']
    
    if len(bpy.data.objects) > 1 :
        bpy.ops.object.join()
```
### PropertyGroups
It might be confusing for someone if a certain custom property is not specifically related to the fractal, and yet have it belong to FractalProperties. That's why I created a **separate property group**. All properties can go together in one group, but color is not a specific property of the fractal: it might as well be a cube or Suzanne (monkey mesh in blender) and get a color with the code. The number of levels, acute angle, inverse fractal... are specific properties of the fractal, which is why only they are allowed in the FractalProperties.
\
\
Again, I register the PropertyGroup & unregister. And I modify my code, as I had accidentally placed the fractal properties in my for loop...
```python
# before
def register():
    for cls in classes:
        bpy.utils.register_class(cls)
        
        bpy.types.Scene.fractal_properties = bpy.props.PointerProperty(type = FractalProperties)

# after
def register():
    for cls in classes:
        bpy.utils.register_class(cls)
        
    bpy.types.Scene.fractal_properties = bpy.props.PointerProperty(type = FractalProperties)
    bpy.types.Scene.mesh_properties = bpy.props.PointerProperty(type = MeshProperties)
```
### Size changer
When I adjust the size, I still encounter a problem (see below).
\
\
Goal: resize the object while keeping its original proportions. I want when I adjust the size of the fractal and when I create a new fractal (so when update_fractal is triggered by changing the number of levels, for example), the size of the fractal is the same and does not shrink or enlarge.
\
\
But this is the issue:
<figure>
  <img src="/object_dimensions.png" alt="No equal faces" title="Transformation">
  <figcaption>Using obj.dimensions = (self.size, self.size, self.size) </figcaption>
</figure>
If I change size, the faces are no longer the same shape...

```python
def update_size(self, context):
    obj = context.object
    obj.scale = (self.size, self.size, self.size)
    # obj.dimensions = (self.size, self.size, self.size)

def update_fractal(self, context):
   # ...
    
    # get size & create new fractal        
    size = bpy.context.scene.fractal_properties.size
    generate_rhombohedron(0, 0, 0, size, self.max_level)
```
Issue with scale & dimensions in Blender:
\
(update_fractal() function is triggered when max_level or inverse_fractal property changed.)
| transformation | proportions of fractal | update_fractal() is triggered |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `obj.scale` | proportions are preserved üëç | size of fractal changes üëé |
| `obj.dimensions` | proportions change, which is normal because we set it to (self.size, self.size, self.size), but dimensions aren't equal with a non-uniform shape like the fractal üëé | size is retained üëç |
<br>

The problem is that Blender automatically adjusts `obj.scale` when you set `obj.dimensions` and vice versa. See video:
<video controls>
  <source src="/dimensions_and_scale.mov" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<br>

I know the dimensions can't be the same for x, y, z like I wrote above.
\
\
It is still not working... searched a lot online, but found nothing, so I asked in a forum. I'm not going to keep looking for it, if I don't succeed, I take it out and use a fixed value.
\
\
For rotation I have the same problem: new rotation position isn't saved when adding new properties...

### Retain color
I can already adjust color (see <a href="/post-15/">blog post</a> about this). But if a new shape is drawn, this color is no longer retained.

‚Üí Solved by adding `update_rgb_colors(context.object, context)` at the end of the `update_fractal()` function - after there has been a join() (or no join at max_level = 0). It takes the current context & context.object of our new fractal object we have now.
```python
def update_fractal(self, context):
    # ...
    generate_rhombohedron(0, 0, 0, size, self.max_level)
    
    bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')
    bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = bpy.data.objects['rhombohedron_object']

    if (len(bpy.data.objects) > 1):
        bpy.ops.object.join()
    
    update_rgb_colors(context.object, context)
```
## Read MIDI messages
Code optimization is still needed, but I was curious about `rtmidi` (a library that the person who created the MidiController add-on had used. I had seen others use this too). I decided to read up on this further. I went back to a standalone project here (away from blender's python api).
\
What follows below is long, but is simply the various steps that come from sources (see below).
\
\
`python-rtmidi` is a wrapper to communicate with midi controllers.
\
\
These are the steps you need to take:
1. Install & import python-rtmidi
    inside terminal:
    ```markdown
    pip3 install python-rtmidi
    ```
    in your project:
    ```python
    import rtmidi
    ```

2. Connect to MIDI device
    ```python
    # initialize midi in handler
    midi_in = rtmidi.MidiIn()
    
    # get all connected ports
    print(midi_in.get_ports()) # delete this afterwards
    
    # open midi on specific port
    midi_in.open_port(0)
    # better: use dictionary to recognise name of MIDI device, so it always connect to that device
    ports_dictionary = {k: v for (v, k) in enumerate(midi_in.get_ports())}
    midi_in.open_port(ports_dictionary["LPD8 mk2"])
    
    # check if port is open
    print(midi_in.is_port_open()) # True
    ```
    
3. Read message
    ```python
    import time
    # if port is open, we get message & read it
    while True: 
    	message_and_dt = midi_in.get_message()
    	if message_and_dt:
            (message, dt) = message_and_dt # unpack
            
            # convert the command integer to a hex so it's easier to read
            command = hex(message[0])
            # see all our messages
            print(f"{command} {message[1:]}\t| dt = {dt:.2f}")
        else:
         # add a short sleep so the while loop doesn't hammer your cpu
            time.sleep(0.001)
    ```
    
When clicking on play button we should see our messages appear when we rotate our controllers or push a button.

Code above is from Mo chreach! 
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYslZkc90GI
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpZDwqsgSpc ‚Üí explanation how to read MIDI messages
<br><br>

When setting up, I got an **circular input error**.
That's because I used the **same name as the module** I'm importing into Python. Python thinks this file is the module itself. Solution: choose a different file name. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59762996/how-to-fix-attributeerror-partially-initialized-module/59777118.)
\
\
Then I experimented some more. When I did this for the pads, I didn't see my command ‚Äúbtn pressed‚Äù, even though this command existed and I saw it in my terminal.
```python
 command = hex(message[0])
 
 if channel == 40: 
	 if command == 0x99:
	   print("btn pressed")
```
It's because I didn't place quotes and now python doesn't recognize it as a string.
\
\
It is important that both have the same type. You can check this by using `print(type(...))`.
\
\
Mo chreach! also mentioned the library `mido`. This is more complex than `rtmidi`, but you can do more with it, according to him. 
\
\
The setup is very similar to `python-rtmidi`. I used the documentation for this: https://mido.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html, where it is a bit mixed up.
```python
# Step 0: install & import mido library
import mido

# Step 1: open specific port
# get your input ports
# print(mido.get_input_names()) 
input_port = mido.open_input('LPD8 mk2') # create input port to receive messages

# Step 2: receive messages
message = input_port.receive()
#print(message) # one message
# iterate through all messages
for message in input_port:
    print(message)
```
Our message looks like this:
- for the pads
    ```python
    note_on channel=9 note=41 velocity=4 time=0
    note_off channel=9 note=41 velocity=0 time=0
    note_on channel=9 note=42 velocity=3 time=0
    note_off channel=9 note=42 velocity=0 time=0
    ```
- for the controls / sliders
    ```python
    control_change channel=0 control=72 value=55 time=0
    control_change channel=0 control=72 value=54 time=0
    control_change channel=0 control=72 value=53 time=0
    control_change channel=0 control=72 value=52 time=0
    control_change channel=0 control=72 value=51 time=0
    control_change channel=0 control=72 value=50 time=0
    control_change channel=0 control=72 value=49 time=0
    ```
Note: I'm going to continue trying to get code clean & correct, and then I move back to midi research (also after end presentation & end summary).
