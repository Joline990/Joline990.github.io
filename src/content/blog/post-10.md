## Done today
- made rhombohedron fractal (see blog post)
- order of to do's changed in my planning roadmap & completed
## Reflection week
### My week in a nutshell
Made 2d Sierpinski Rhombus fractal in Processing & also converted it to 3d in Python.
Also briefly focused on TouchDesigner.
### Terms of the week
- Rhombus
- Vertices
- Faces
- Rhombohedron
### Planning
I wanted to have a research question and deliverables defined by the end of this week and the exploration phase finished. Research question succeeded, deliverables I will probably go for 1 experimental version where users can modify the fractal. The exploration phase is also at an end. If I am still going to explore things now, it is rather because this is for a specific purpose and not to explore the whole fractal world.

The first half of the week went really well, I knew more and more what I wanted to achieve at the end of this project. I knew that converting it into 3d would take me some effort to program, but that I would think it was really cool if I succeeded with the rhombohedron fractal. I did eventually succeed, but without help from a certain paper, among others, I don't think I would have succeeded in a short time. I would have switched to fractal trees then.

I'm roughly on track. Not quite where I wanted to be, but it's okay. I would have liked to have been able to look into other softwares already to make the rhombohedron fractal to see if the performance is better.
### Next steps
- see how performance can be improved such that we can also create iteration 3 and higher without our computer crashing.
- rotate 3d fractal
- add interaction

### Goal for next week
- Take more leisure time
