## Sierpinski Triangle
Today I want to focus on the Sierpinski Triangle and try to recreate it in different software I have not yet worked with. But first some background.

### Background info
Inventor: **Wac≈Çaw Sierpi≈Ñski**
\
Year: 1915, but early versions also found in Roman churches.
\
\
How is it made?
- **Remove each time the middle triangle** (by taking the midpoint of the sides of the triangles & connect it with a line segment, then delete the triangle you made) of the triangle, so that three new triangles are created. The number of triangles can be calculated using the formula: number of triangles = 3 to the power of the number of iterations.
\
\
Peculiarities:
- Equilateral triangles
- It is related to Pascal‚Äôs triangle
- **Chaos Game** = a method of creating a fractal randomly (found by Barnsley in 1988), but the end result is not always a fractal. But as I did research, I found that the Sierpinski Triangle can be created using this method. The rules are simple: (1) you pick a random point inside a polygon. (2) Take a random vertex with one of the points of the polygon. And take the and take the centre of the line segment. (3) Now you start at that point & choose again a random point of the polygon. The goal is to remember where you are. Iterate further and the Sierpinski Triangle is shown.

- The area of this fractal leads to zero as you iterate further and further, thus having more levels.
<br>
<br>
Variations:

- Sierpinski carpet (there you remove the middle square by first divide the square into 9 equal squares)
- Apollonian gasket (circles)
- Sierpinski pedal triangle (no equilateral triangle)
- In 3d: Sierpinski Tetrahedron = Tetrix

### Processing

Since I have already used processing short in the first 2 days, this seemed like a good idea to test it out first.

I started from this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AvyvJnkdjE), which first drew a triangle in the middle, I thought it was quite bizarre how it was working, so I decided to look up some other tutorials on processing first, but there wasn't really anything I liked, so I started myself.

We need a bit of maths before implementing in Processing.

#### 1. Draw triangle in the centre of the canvas

To do this, we first need to know the coordinates of our triangle.
<figure>
  <img src="/sierpinski_coordinates.webp" alt="Calculation coordinates triangle" title="Math">
  <figcaption>Calculation of all necessary coordinates to centre triangle on our canvas.</figcaption>
</figure>
The y-coordinate is more difficult to calculate, but for this we can use the sine of an acute angle in a **rectangular triangle**.

We can draw the triangle using triangle() where we can include all the coordinates.

```java
int side = 200;

triangle(
width/2, height/2 - (sin(PI/3)*side)/2,
width/2 + side/2, height/2 + (sin(PI/3)*side)/2,
width/2 - side/2, height/2 + (sin(PI/3)*side)/2
);
```

We have a lot of repetition here, so let's start avoiding this. We can do this by first moving our triangle to (width/2, height/2).

```java
float halfHeightTriangle = sin(PI/3) * side/2;

pushMatrix();
translate(x, y);
fill(0,0,255);
noStroke();
triangle(0, -heightTriangle, side/2, heightTriangle, -side/2, heightTriangle);
popMatrix();
```

I am using pushMatrix() and popMatrix() as seen in tutorial, this is going to ensure that we save the current transformation state and then return it to the original.

#### 2. Multiple triangels

We create a new function removeTriangle() in which we keep track of the length of a triangle side & the current iteration. For this, I took the idea from this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwDkUxrFb0s, but he didn't draw his triangle in the middle of the canvas, so I had to do my own calculations.<br><br>

It is important to put a maximum in your function, otherwise the function will keep looping in infinity (as mentioned a few blog posts earlier). We do this by checking the maximum iterations.

We make the side half as small, as shown in the Sierpinski triangle.

```java
int maxIterations = 3;

void removeTriangle(float x, float y, float side, int iteration) {
if ( iteration == maxIterations) {
drawTriangle(x, y, side);
} else {
//draw 3 new triangles inside the original triangle
float halfHeightTriangle = sin(PI/3) * side/2;
removeTriangle(x, y - halfHeightTriangle/2, side/2, iteration + 1);
removeTriangle(x + side/4, y + halfHeightTriangle/2, side/2, iteration + 1);
removeTriangle(x - side/4, y + halfHeightTriangle/2, side/2, iteration + 1);
}
}
```

## L-systems & trees

I‚Äôm fascinated by Fractal Trees, they look very realistic, so I had to discover this.

### Background info

Inventor: **Aristid Lindenmayer**
\
Year: 1968
\
L-systems are also called Lindenmayer systems.
\
\
How is it made?

- It uses an alphabet by which sentences are formed. The sentences become longer by applying rules to them.
- There are 3 components that make up an L-system
    - An **alphabet**: these are the characters that can be used to form sentences.
    - An **axiom**: this is actually the starting point. You get a sentence or a character and apply the rules.
    - **Rules**: there are rules to start replacing a letter with a sentence when you encounter one, for example
- You can start drawing an L-system with **Turtle graphics üê¢** where you have to think of a turtle that you have different instructions on how it should move. An alphabet has been created, so ‚ÄòF‚Äô means draw a line and move forward. Click on some examples here to see such weird code without programming: https://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev/lsystems/. Turtle graphics as it were translates the output of an L-system and turns it into a drawing by starting to use different commands.
- With L-systems you can start making fractals like the Sierpinski triangle, koch snowflake cantor set....
- Found different sources, but I think Daniel Shiffman explains it very well: https://natureofcode.com/fractals/ (trees & L-systems).

### Tutorial

In the evening, I quickly tried out a short demo of Nature of Code, creating a basic fractal tree.

## Sidenote about fractal dimensions

As I‚Äôm speaking of that I wanted to explore 3d fractals, as my topic, they are **not really three-dimensional**. 

When I was reading about fractals in articles, I found fractal dimension & something with logarithms. But I didn‚Äôt understand it. But then I found this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZvhWYRDK70 that explains how you can calculate the dimension of a fractal. It is not always what you would expect. For example, the Sierpinski triangle has a fractal dimension of 1.585 and the Sierpinski tetrahedron has a fractal dimension of 2. 
> This means that the Sierpinski tetrahedron is a fractal object that **exists in 3D space**, but its fractal dimension (= 2) means that it has **properties closer to a 2D surface** than to a fully 3D object.

It was Felix Hausdorff that discovered this (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension).
